# Other Generators

We mentioned the possibility to bypass Hugo and use your own building method in Section \@ref(methods). Basically you have to build the site using `blogdown::build_site(method = "custom")`, and provide your own building script `/R/build.R`. In this chapter, we show you how to work with other popular static site generators like Jekyll and Hexo. Besides these static site generators written in other languages, there is actually a simple site generator written in R provided in the **rmarkdown** package [@R-rmarkdown], and we will introduce it in Section \@ref(rmd-website).

## Jekyll

For Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com) \index{Jekyll}users, I have prepared a minimal example in the GitHub repository [yihui/blogdown-jekyll.](https://github.com/yihui/blogdown-jekyll) If you clone or download this repository and open `blogdown-jekyll.Rproj` in RStudio, you can still use all addins mentioned in Section \@ref(rstudio-ide), such as "New Post," "Serve Site," and "Update Metadata," but it is Jekyll instead of Hugo that builds the website behind the scenes now.

I assume you are familiar with Jekyll, and I'm not going to introduce the basics of Jekyll in this section. For example, you should know what the `_posts/` and `_site/` directories mean.

The key pieces of this **blogdown-jekyll** project are the files `.Rprofile`, `R/build.R`, and `R/build_one.R`. I have set some global R options for this project in `.Rprofile`:^[If you are not familiar with this file, please read Section \@ref(global-options).]

```r
options(
  blogdown.generator = "jekyll",
  blogdown.method = "custom",
  blogdown.subdir = "_posts"
)
```

First, the website generator was set to `jekyll` using the option `blogdown.generator`, so that **blogdown** knows that it should use Jekyll to build the site. Second, the build method `blogdown.method` was set to `custom`, so that we can define our custom R script `R/build.R` to build the Rmd files (I will explain the reason later). Third, the default subdirectory for new posts was set to `_posts`, which is Jekyll's convention. After you set this option, the "New Post" addin will create new posts under the `_posts/` directory.

When the option `blogdown.method` is `custom`, **blogdown** will call the R script `R/build.R` to build the site. You have full freedom to do whatever you want in this script. Below is an example script:

```{r eval=FALSE}
build_one = function(io) {
  # if output is not older than input, skip the compilation
  if (!blogdown:::require_rebuild(io[2], io[1])) return()

  message('* knitting ', io[1])
  if (blogdown:::Rscript(shQuote(c('R/build_one.R', io))) != 0) {
    unlink(io[2])
    stop('Failed to compile ', io[1], ' to ', io[2])
  }
}

# Rmd files under the root directory
rmds = list.files('.', '[.]Rmd$', recursive = T, full.names = T)
files = cbind(rmds, xfun::with_ext(rmds, '.md'))

for (i in seq_len(nrow(files))) build_one(files[i, ])

system2('jekyll', 'build')
```

- Basically it contains a function\index{blogdown::build\_one()} `build_one()` that takes an argument `io`, which is a character vector of length 2. The first element is the input (Rmd) filename, and the second element is the output filename.

- Then we search for all Rmd files under the current directory, prepare the output filenames by substituting the Rmd file extensions with `.md`, and build the Rmd files one by one. Note there is a caching mechanism in `build_one()` that makes use of an internal **blogdown** function `require_rebuild()`. This function returns `FALSE` if the output file is not older than the input file in terms of the modification time. This can save you some time because those Rmd files that have been compiled before will not be compiled again every time. The key step in `build_one()` is to run the R script `R/build_one.R`, which we will explain later.

- Lastly, we build the website through a system call of the command `jekyll build`.

The script `R/build_one.R` looks like this (I have omitted some non-essential settings for simplicity):

```r
local({
  # fall back on "/" if baseurl is not specified
  baseurl = blogdown:::get_config2("baseurl", default = "/")
  knitr::opts_knit$set(base.url = baseurl)
  knitr::render_jekyll()  # set output hooks

  # input/output filenames as two arguments to Rscript
  a = commandArgs(TRUE)
  d = gsub("^_|[.][a-zA-Z]+$", "", a[1])
  knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    fig.path   = sprintf("figure/%s/", d),
    cache.path = sprintf("cache/%s/", d)
  )
  knitr::knit(
    a[1], a[2], quiet = TRUE, encoding = "UTF-8",
    envir = globalenv()
  )
})
```

- The script is wrapped in `local()` so that an Rmd file is knitted in a clean global environment, and the variables such as `baseurl`, `a`, and `d` will not be created in the global environment, i.e., `globalenv()` used by `knitr::knit()` below.

- The **knitr** package option `base.url` is a URL to be prepended to figure paths. We need to set this option to make sure figures generated from R code chunks can be found when they are displayed on a web page. A normal figure path is often like `figure/foo.png`, and it may not work when the image is rendered to an HTML file, because `figure/foo.png` is a relative path, and there is no guarantee that this image file will be copied to the directory of the final HTML file. For example, for an Rmd source file `_posts/2015-07-23-hello.Rmd` that generates `figure/foo.png` (under `_posts/`), the final HTML file may be `_site/2015/07/23/hello/index.html`. Jekyll knows how to render an HTML file to this location, but it does not understand the image dependency and will not copy the image file to this location. To solve this issue, we render figures at the root directory `/figure/`, which will be copied to `_site/` by Jekyll. To refer to an image under `_site/figure/`, we need the leading slash (`baseurl`), e.g., `<img src="/figure/foo.png">`. This is an absolute path, so no matter where the HTML is rendered, this path always works.

- What `knitr::render_jekyll()` does\index{knitr::render\_jekyll()} is mainly to set up some **knitr** output hooks so that source code and text output from R code chunks will be wrapped in Liquid tags `{% highlight %}` and `{% end highlight %}`.

- Remember in `build.R`, we passed the variable `io` to the Rscript call `blogdown:::Rscript`. Here in `build_one.R`, we can receive them from `commandArgs(TRUE)`. The variable `a` contains an `.Rmd` and an `.md` file path. We removed the possible leading underscore (`^_`) and the extension (`[.][a-zA-Z]$`) in the path. Next we set figure and cache paths using this string. For example, for a post `_posts/foo.Rmd`, its figures will be written to `figure/foo/` and its cache databases (if there are any) will be stored under `cache/foo/`. Both directories are under the root directory of the project.

- Lastly, we call `knitr::knit()` to knit the Rmd file to a Markdown output file, which will be processed by Jekyll later.

A small caveat is that since we have both `.Rmd` and `.md` files, Jekyll will treat both types of files as Markdown files by default. You have to ask Jekyll to ignore `.Rmd` files and only build `.md` files. You can set the option `exclude` in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
exclude: ['*.Rmd']
```

Compared to the Hugo support in **blogdown**, this approach is limited in a few aspects:

1. It does not support Pandoc, so you cannot use Pandoc's Markdown. Since it uses the **knitr** package instead of **rmarkdown**, you cannot use any of **bookdown**'s Markdown features, either. You are at the mercy of the Markdown renderers supported by Jekyll.

1. Without **rmarkdown**, you cannot use HTML widgets. Basically, all you can have are dynamic text output and R graphics output from R code chunks. They may or may not suffice, depending on your specific use cases.

It may be possible for us to remove these limitations in a future version of **blogdown**, if there are enough happy Jekyll users in the R community.

## Hexo

The ideas of using\index{Hexo} Hexo (https://hexo.io) are very similar to what we have applied to Jekyll in the previous section. I have also prepared a minimal example in the GitHub repository [yihui/blogdown-hexo.](https://github.com/yihui/blogdown-hexo)

The key components of this repository are still `.Rprofile`, `R/build.R`, and `R/build_one.R`. We set the option `blogdown.generator` to `hexo`, the `build.method` to `custom`, and the default subdirectory for new posts to `source/_posts`.

```r
options(
  blogdown.generator = 'hexo',
  blogdown.method = 'custom',
  blogdown.subdir = 'source/_posts'
)
```

The script `R/build.R` is similar to the one in the `blogdown-jekyll` repository. The main differences are:

1. We find all Rmd files under the `source/` directory instead of the root directory, because Hexo's convention is to put all source files under `source/`.

1. We call `system2('hexo', 'generate')` to build the website.

For the script `R/build_one.R`, the major difference with the script in the `blogdown-jekyll` repository is that we set the `base.dir` option for **knitr**, so that all R figures are generated to the `source/` directory. This is because Hexo copies everything under `source/` to `public/`, whereas Jekyll copies everything under the root directory to `_site/`.

```r
local({
  # fall back on '/' if baseurl is not specified
  baseurl = blogdown:::get_config2('root', '/')
  knitr::opts_knit$set(
    base.url = baseurl, base.dir = normalizePath('source')
  )

  # input/output filenames as two arguments to Rscript
  a = commandArgs(TRUE)
  d = gsub('^source/_?|[.][a-zA-Z]+$', '', a[1])
  knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    fig.path   = sprintf('figure/%s/', d),
    cache.path = sprintf('cache/%s/', d)
  )
  knitr::knit(
    a[1], a[2], quiet = TRUE, encoding = 'UTF-8', envir = .GlobalEnv
  )
})
```

This repository is also automatically built and deployed through Netlify\index{Netlify} when I push changes to it. Since Hexo is a Node package, and Netlify supports Node, you can easily install Hexo on Netlify. For example, this example repository uses the command `npm install && hexo generate` to build the website; `npm install` will install the Node packages specified in `packages.json` (a file under the root directory of the repository), and `hexo generate` is the command to build the website from `source/` to `public/`.

## Default site generator in rmarkdown {#rmd-website}

Before **blogdown** was invented\index{R Markdown Site Generator}, there was actually a relatively simple way to render websites using **rmarkdown**. The structure of the website has to be a flat directory of Rmd files (no subdirectories for Rmd files) and a configuration file in which you can specify a navigation bar for all your pages and output format options.

You can find more information about this site generator in its documentation at http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html, and we are not going to repeat the documentation here, but just want to highlight the major differences between the default site generator in **rmarkdown** and other specialized site generators like Hugo:

- The **rmarkdown** site generator requires all Rmd files to be under the root directory. Hugo has no constraints on the site structure, and you can create arbitrary directories and files under `/content/`.

- Hugo is a general-purpose site generator that is highly customizable, and there are a lot of things that **rmarkdown**'s default site generator does not support, e.g., RSS feeds, metadata especially common in blogs such as categories and tags, and customizing permanent links for certain pages.

There are still legitimate reasons to choose the **rmarkdown** default site generator, even though it does not appear to be as powerful as Hugo, including:

- You are familiar with generating single-page HTML output from R Markdown, and all you want is to extend this to generating multiple pages from multiple Rmd files.

- It suffices to use a flat directory of Rmd files. You do not write a blog or need RSS feeds.

- You prefer the Bootstrap styles. In theory, you can also apply Bootstrap styles to Hugo websites, but it will require you to learn more about Hugo. Bootstrap is well supported in **rmarkdown**, and you can spend more time on the configurations instead of learning the technical details about how it works.

- There are certain features in **rmarkdown** HTML output that are missing in **blogdown**. For example, currently you cannot easily print data frames as paged tables, add a floating table of contents, or fold/unfold code blocks dynamically in the output of **blogdown**. All these could be implemented via JavaScript and CSS, but it is certainly not as simple as specifying a few options in **rmarkdown** like `toc_float: true`.

Please note that the **rmarkdown** site generator is extensible, too. For example, the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] is essentially a custom site generator to generate books as websites. 

## pkgdown

The **pkgdown** package\index{pkgdown} (@R-pkgdown, https://github.com/hadley/pkgdown) can help you quickly turn the R documentation of an R package (including help pages and vignettes) into a website. It is independent of **blogdown** and solves a specific problem. It is not a general-purpose website generator. We want to mention it in this book because it is very easy to use, and also highly useful. You can find the instructions on its website or in its GitHub repository.
