# Personal Experience

I started blogging at blogchina.com in 2005, moved to blog.com.cn, then MSN Space, and finally purchased my own domain `yihui.name` and a virtual host. I first used a PHP application named Bo-Blog, then switched to WordPress, and then Jekyll. Finally I moved to Hugo. Although I have moved several times, all my posts have been preserved, and you can still see my first post in Chinese in 2005. I often try my best not to introduce broken links (which lead to the 404 page) every time I change the backend of my website. When it is too hard to preserve the original links of certain pages, I will redirect the broken URLs to the new URLs. That is why it is important for your system to support redirections, and in particular, 301 redirections (Netlify does a nice job here). Here are some of my redirection rules: https://github.com/rbind/yihui/blob/master/static/_redirects. For example, `http://yihui.name/en/feed/` was the RSS feed of my old WordPress and Jekyll blogs in English, and Hugo generates the RSS feed to `/en/index.xml` instead, so I need to redirect `/en/feed/` to `/en/index.xml`.

Google has provided several tools to help you know more information about your website. For example, [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) can collect visitor statistics and give speed suggestions for your website. [Google Webmasters](https://www.google.com/webmasters/) can show you the broken links it finds. I use these tools frequently by myself.

I firmly believe in the value of writing. Over the years, I have written more than 1000 posts in Chinese and English. Some are long, and most are short. The total size of these text files is about 5 Mb. In retrospect, most posts are probably not valuable to general readers (some are random thoughts, and some are my rants), but I feel I benefitted a lot from writing in two aspects:

1. If I sit down and focus on writing a small topic for a while, I often feel my thoughts will become clearer. A major difference between writing and talking is that you can always reorganize things and revise them when writing. I do not think writing on social media counts. 140 characters may well be thoughtful, but I feel there is so much chaos there. It is hard to lay out systematic thoughts only through short messages, and these quick messages are often quickly forgotten.

1. I know some bloggers are very much against comments, so they do not open comments to the public. I have not had a very negative experience with comments yet. On the contrary, I constantly find inspirations from comments. For example, [I was thinking](https://yihui.name/en/2013/04/travis-ci-for-r/) if it was possible to automatically check R packages on the cloud through Travis CI. At that time (April 2013), I believe not many people in the R community had started using Travis CI, although I'm not sure if I was the first person experimenting with this idea. I felt Travis CI could be promising, but it did not support R back then. Someone named Vincent Arel-Bundock (I still do not know him) told me a hack in a comment, which suddenly lit up my mind and I quickly figured out a solution. In October 2013, Craig Citro started more solid work on the R support on Travis CI. I do not know if he saw my blog post. Anyway, I think Travis CI has made substantial impact on R package developers, which is a great thing for the R community.

Yet another relatively small benefit is that I often go to my own posts to learn some technical stuff that I have forgotten. For example, I find it difficult to remember the syntax of different types of zero-width assertions in Perl-like regular expressions: `(?=...)`, `(?!...)`, `(?<=...)`, and `(?<!...)`. So I wrote a short blog post and gave myself a few minimal examples. After going back to that post a few times, finally I can remember how to use these regular expressions.
